# Revision history for harch-web

## 0.1.2.0

## 0.1.1.0

* Initial stub facade package for the SSR framework boundary.
* Added the first public facade types and functions: `Application`, `Page`, `RouteCodec`, `application`, `matchRoute`, and `runServer`.
* Extended the facade to carry routed request context and to distinguish page responses from future API/data responses.
* Added package-local unit tests for route matching and the stub server boundary.
* Wired the package into first-party repository conventions with lowercase package naming and `Custom` setup that copies the root `LICENSE` file.
