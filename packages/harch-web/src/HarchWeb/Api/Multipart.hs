-- | A bounded, incremental @multipart\/form-data@ boundary scanner (RFC 7578,
-- RFC 2046 section 5.1). This module only segments an arbitrarily-chunked
-- byte stream into per-part header blocks and body byte ranges; it does not
-- decode field names, filenames, or apply size limits itself, and it does
-- not yet integrate with a WAI request body. Those are documented future
-- extensions (see @TASKS.md@ item AB).
--
-- The scanner never buffers more of a part's body than the length of the
-- boundary delimiter: once a prefix of the buffered bytes is confirmed not to
-- be part of the next delimiter, it is emitted immediately as a
-- 'MultipartPartBodyChunk' and dropped from the retained state. This is the
-- property that lets a caller stream large file parts without buffering them
-- whole.
